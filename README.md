## [Live](https://filmlab.vercel.app/)

### This movie application is built using Next.js, Redux Toolkit, Redux Thunk, useEffect, and useState. The design is powered by Material-UI and is fully responsive, featuring a sidebar that appears on smaller screens. The application supports both dark and light modes, allowing users to switch between themes.

### The TMDb API is utilized to fetch data across four different slices: Top Rated Movies, Popular Movies, Cast details, and Trailers. Each slice is managed separately in Redux.
### Key features include:
+ #### Top Rated Page: Data is fetched page by page, with a "Load More" button to view additional content.
+ #### Movie Posters: Display options to add movies to a Watchlist, view details via an info icon, and show the movie's name and IMDb rating.
+ #### Trailers: Trailers are opened directly on YouTube by clicking the play icon.
